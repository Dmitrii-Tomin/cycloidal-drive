## Introduction

Welcome to the 3D Printed Cycloidal Drive project! This project provides the design files and instructions to create a fully functional model of a cycloidal drive using 3D printing technology. This model demonstrates the inner workings of a cycloidal drive, showcasing its high torque and precision, making it an excellent tool for educational purposes, as well as for applications in robotics and automation.

## Features

- High torque output relative to size.
- Compact and efficient design.
- Low backlash for precise motion control.
- Designed for easy 3D printing and assembly.
- Customizable for different applications.

## Bill of Materials



## Installation

### Preparation

1. Download the STL files from the `cycloidal_drive_parts.zip` file or from [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/928009-cycloidal-drive).
2. Use your preferred slicing software to prepare the files for your 3D printer.

### Print

3. Recommended print settings:
   - Layer height: 0.2mm
   - Infill: 50%
   - Supports: Yes (where necessary)
4. Print the parts using PLA, PETG, or any other durable filament of your choice.

### Assemble

5. For a step-by-step visual guide, refer to the `cycloidal_drive_assembly_guide.pdf` file in the repository.
6. Test fit all parts to ensure proper alignment before final assembly.
7. Lubricate moving parts with grease to reduce friction and wear.
8. Assemble the cycloidal drive following the guide, securing parts with the appropriate screws and nuts.

### Modify

9. If you want to modify something, download the `cycloidal_drive_fusion.f3d` file and make your modifications in Fusion 360.

## Operation

Once assembled, the cycloidal drive can be used in various applications such as:

- **Robotics:** Precision motion control for robotic arms and joints.
- **Automation:** Actuators in automated systems.
- **Educational Projects:** Demonstrations and experiments in mechanical engineering.

To operate the drive:

- Rotate the input shaft to see the high-torque output motion.
- Observe the smooth, precise movement with minimal backlash.

This model is an excellent tool for demonstrating the principles and benefits of cycloidal drives.
